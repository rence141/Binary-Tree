# HeapMaster: Prioritize Your Data

HeapMaster is an interactive C++ program that allows users to explore and manage **Min-Heaps** and **Max-Heaps**. The program provides an intuitive command-line interface for inserting elements, deleting the smallest or largest element, and visualizing the heap structure. It is a simple and engaging way to work with heap data structures and their associated operations.

## Features

### Min-Heap Operations:
- **Insert elements** into the heap.
- **Delete the smallest priority** (root element).
- **Retrieve the smallest priority** and display it.
- **Visualize the heap** in a tree-like structure.

### Max-Heap Operations:
- **Insert elements** into the heap.
- **Delete the largest priority** (root element).
- **Retrieve the largest priority** and display it.
- **Visualize the heap** in a tree-like structure.

## Getting Started
